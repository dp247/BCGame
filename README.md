# Bulls and Cows

Bulls and Cows is a Windows command line game created by following of Ben Tristem's Unreal Engine course on Udemy, with extra functionality and coding standards implemented by me.
It was undertaken towards the end of my placement as a refresher on C++ coding (since my placement was in QA) and also allowed time to get used to Unreal's coding practices, moderately advanced C++ data types and the usage of source control in Visual Studio.

The game itself is based on the paper and pen game of the same name, but with words instead of numbers. Currently, the player has 8 attempts to guess a single word and is scored on the number of bulls (correct letters in the right places) and cows (correct letters in the wrong places). The player can also play multiple games.

Before finishing this game completely, I would like to add support for reading in and choosing a random word from a text file, in order to make the game replayable.
